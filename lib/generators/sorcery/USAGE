Description:
  Generates the necessary files to get you up and running with Sorcery gem
  
Examples:
  rails generate sorcery:install

    This will generate the core migration file, the initializer file and the 'User' model class.

  rails generate sorcery:install remember_me reset_password

    This will generate the migrations files for remember_me and reset_password submodules
    and will create the initializer file (and add submodules to it), and create the 'User' model class.

  rails generate sorcery:install --model Person

    This will generate the core migration file, the initializer and change the model class
    (in the initializer and migration files) to the class 'Person' (and it's pluralized version, 'people')

  rails generate sorcery:install http_basic_auth external remember_me --migrations

    This will generate only the migration files for the specified submodules and will
    add them to the initializer file.
