## 0.8.6

* `current_user` returns `nil` instead of `false` if there's no user loggd in (#493)
* MongoMapper adapter does not override `save!` method anymore. However due to ORM's lack of support for `validate: false` in `save!`, the combination of `validate: false` and `raise_on_failure: true` is not possible in MongoMapper. The errors will not be raised in this situation. (#151)
* Fixed rename warnings for bcrypt-ruby
* The way Sorcery adapters are included has been changed due to problem with multiple `included` blocks error in `ActiveSupport::Concern` class (#527)
* Session timeout works with new cookie serializer introduced in Rails 4.1
* Rails 4.1 compatibility bugs were fixed, this version is fully supported (#538)
* VK providers now supports `scope` option
* Support for DataMapper added
* Helpers for integration tests were added
* Fixed problems with special characters in user login attributes (MongoMapper & Mongoid)
* Fixed remaining `password_confirmation` value - it is now cleared just like `password`

## 0.8.5
* Fixed add_provider_to_user with CamelCased authentications_class model (#382)
* Fixed unlock_token_mailer_disabled to only disable automatic mailing (#467)
* Make send_email_* methods easier to overwrite (#473)
* Don't add `:username` field for User. Config option `username_attribute_names` is now `:email` by default instead of `:username`.

  If you're using `username` as main field for users to login, you'll need to tune your Sorcery config:

    ```ruby
    config.user_config do |user|
      # ...
      user.username_attribute_names = [:username]
    end
    ```
* `rails generate sorcery:install` now works inside Rails engine

## 0.8.4

  * Few security fixes in `external` module

## 0.8.3 (yanked because of bad Jeweler release)

## 0.8.2

* Activity logging feature has a new column called `last_login_from_ip_address` (string type). If you use ActiveRecord, you will have to add this column to DB ([#465](https://github.com/NoamB/sorcery/issues/465))

Fixed bug in reset_password - after reset can't login due to bad salt creation. Affected only Mongoid.

Added a rake task to create it.

```
rake sorcery:bootstrap
```

## 0.3.1

Renamed "oauth" module to "external" and made API prettier.
```
auth_at_provider(provider) => login_at(provider)
